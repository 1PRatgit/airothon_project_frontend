## Solution Approach
Redundant Data in Data Lake - Backend API
This project is a Flask-based backend API for storing and retrieving data related to the Redundant Data in Data Lake project. It uses SQLite and SQLAlchemy for the database aspect.

## Installation
Clone this repository: git clone <repository_url>
Navigate to the project directory: cd backend
Install the required packages: pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
To run the Flask app, use the following command:

sh
Copy code
flask run
The API endpoints for fetching and pushing data are:

GET /Assembly and POST /Assembly: Use these endpoints to fetch and push data to and from the Assembly table.
GET /subAssembly and POST /subAssembly: Use these endpoints to fetch and push data to and from the Sub-Assembly table.
GET /fabrication and POST /fabrication: Use these endpoints to fetch and push data to and from the Fabrication table.
POST /login: Use this endpoint to login and access the data.
The data is assumed to be forecasted data and real-time data entered by the user.

## Database Schema
The database schema for this project is designed to be in the 2nd Normal Form (2NF). It consists of three tables:

assembly table
sub_assembly table
fabrication table
Security
To protect the data in the API endpoints, a login mechanism has been implemented. Users need to enter their login credentials to access the data.

Limitations and Future Work
This project is still in its early stages and has some limitations. For example, the database could be further optimized to reduce redundancy and increase efficiency.

In the future, we plan to add support for JWT authentication and authorization. We also plan to integrate the front-end ReactJS application with the API to create a complete solution for the Redundant Data in Data Lake project.
