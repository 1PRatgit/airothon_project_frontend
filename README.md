## Solution Approach
Redundant Data in Data Lake - Backend API
This project is a Flask-based backend API for storing and retrieving data related to the Redundant Data in Data Lake project. It uses SQLite and SQLAlchemy for the database aspect.

## Installation
Clone this repository: git clone <repository_url>
Navigate to the project directory: cd backend
Install the required packages: pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
To run the Flask app, use the following command:

- sh
- Copy code
- flask run
The API endpoints for fetching and pushing data are:

- GET /Assembly and POST /Assembly: Use these endpoints to fetch and push data to and from the Assembly table.
- GET /subAssembly and POST /subAssembly: Use these endpoints to fetch and push data to and from the Sub-Assembly table.
- GET /fabrication and POST /fabrication: Use these endpoints to fetch and push data to and from the Fabrication table.
- POST /login: Use this endpoint to login and access the data.
- The data is assumed to be forecasted data and real-time data entered by the user.

## Database Schema
The database schema for this project is designed to be in the 2nd Normal Form (2NF). It consists of three tables:

- assembly table
- sub_assembly table
- fabrication table
- Security
- To protect the data in the API endpoints, a login mechanism has been implemented. Users need to enter their login credentials to access the data.

## Limitations and Future Work
- This project is still in its early stages and has some limitations. For example, the database could be further optimized to reduce redundancy and increase efficiency.

- In the future, we plan to add support for JWT authentication and authorization. We also plan to integrate the front-end ReactJS application with the API to create a complete solution for the Redundant Data in Data Lake project.
